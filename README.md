This repository contains solutions to the projects from **Nand2Tetris Part 1**:

- **Project 1: Boolean Logic**  
  Implement basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) using only the NAND gate.

- **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**  
  Build adders, incrementers, and arithmetic logic units (ALU).

- **Project 3: Sequential Logic**  
  Construct flip-flops and registers for memory.

- **Project 4: Machine Language**  
  Develop a basic assembler for converting assembly code into binary instructions.

- **Project 5: The CPU**  
  Build the Central Processing Unit (CPU) capable of processing a set of instructions.

- **Project 6: The Computer**  
  Integrate the CPU, memory, and input/output devices into a working computer.
